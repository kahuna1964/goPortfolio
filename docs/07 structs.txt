fmt.Printf("This is our person %v\n", person) -> This is our person {Jamie 61}
fmt.Printf("This is our person %+v\n", person) -> This is our person {Name:Jamie Age:61}



Anonymous struct
----------------
employee := struct {
	name string
	id   int
}{
	name: "Alice",
	id:   123,
}

fmt.Printf("This is our employee %v\n", employee) -> This is our employee {Alice 123}
fmt.Printf("This is our employee %+v\n", employee) -> This is our employee {name:Alice id:123}
